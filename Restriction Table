| Onion (fresh bulb, high-FODMAP)         | **Green onion (scallion) tops**; **Chives**; **Leek greens**; **Asafoetida (hing)** (pinch, as spice)                                                                         | 1 small onion ≈ 1 cup chopped scallion green parts (use equivalent volume); *or* 1 tsp asafoetida powder to flavor a whole dish | 1 cup scallion greens \~ 50 g  | Garlic and onion are notorious FODMAP triggers (rich in fructans). **Scallion (green onion) tops** – the dark green parts – are low in FODMAPs and can be used liberally to impart an onion-like flavor. For example, instead of 1 diced yellow onion, you might use a bunch of scallion greens (approx a cup chopped). They have a milder onion flavor, so you can also add **chives** (which are low-FODMAP) as a raw garnish or stirred in at the end for extra allium punch. **Leek leaves (green part)** are another alternative – the greens of leeks are low-FODMAP in moderate quantity (up to 2/3 cup) and bring a slightly sweeter onion flavor; use similar volume as you would onion. If you need that base flavor from the start of cooking, **asafoetida (hing)** is a spice that, in tiny amounts, gives a garlic-onion aroma when sautéed in oil. Typically, you’d use just a pinch (say 1/8 teaspoon or a knife’s tip) for a whole pot of soup or curry – too much and it can be bitter. Fry it briefly in oil at the beginning of cooking (traditionally used in Indian cuisine as an onion/garlic sub). It’s very potent but effective – just ensure the brand is gluten-free if needed (some mix it with wheat, though many are now blended with rice flour). Another approach: use **infused oils** (garlic- or onion-infused olive oil) – since the fructans aren’t oil-soluble, you can simmer a cut onion or garlic clove in oil and then remove it; the oil retains flavor and is low-FODMAP. For instance, start your recipe with 2 tablespoons of garlic-infused oil instead of garlic, and perhaps throw in the green scallions later for a mellow onion taste. These strategies combined can approximate the depth of real onions without the FODMAP load. Keep in mind the dish may lack some of the sweetness/bulk onions give; you can add a bit of finely diced carrot or celery early for aromatic bulk if tolerated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Garlic (fresh, high-FODMAP)             | **Garlic-infused oil**; **Garlic chives or scapes**; **Asafoetida** (same as above)                                                                                           | 1 clove garlic = use 1 Tbsp garlic-infused oil (added at start or finish); *or* 1 Tbsp chopped garlic chives (to finish)        | 1 Tbsp = 15 ml                 | Garlic’s flavor is hard to replace, but its fructans mean whole garlic is off-limits. **Garlic-infused oil** is a staple low-FODMAP substitute. You can either buy it or make it by gently warming garlic cloves in oil and then discarding them. The flavorful oil can then be used in recipes – for sautéing or drizzling. Typically, 1 clove’s worth of flavor might be delivered by \~1 tablespoon of well-infused oil (depending on oil strength). Use it at the same stage you’d use garlic – e.g., fry other ingredients in it or add towards the end for a burst of aroma. The oil picks up the garlic essence without the fructan content (do not actually blend/puree the garlic in, just use the infusion). **Garlic chives** (also known as Chinese chives) have a garlicky flavor and are low-FODMAP – you can chop a tablespoon or two of the green blades to toss into a dish for a hint of garlic taste. They are best added near the end (like chives) to maintain their flavor. **Garlic scapes** (the green shoots of garlic) might also be used if available – they have less fructan than bulbs (small quantities likely okay), and you could stir-fry some sliced scapes as an aromatic. **Asafoetida** again serves as a garlic/onion surrogate – a tiny pinch in hot oil gives a whiff of garlic. Also consider spices like cumin, mustard seed, or the use of strong herbs (rosemary, etc.) to distract the palate from missing garlic. If making something like garlic bread, you can brush infused oil mixed with finely chopped parsley on the bread for a decent approximation. Always remember that while the flavor can be approached, it won’t be exactly the same – but on low-FODMAP, avoiding the painful triggers is worth the slight flavor compromise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Wheat flour (for bread or baking)       | **Gluten-free flour blend** (rice, corn, potato based); **Spelt flour (white, in limited amounts)**; **Oat flour (certified GF)**; **Almond or coconut flour** (if tolerated) | 1 cup wheat flour = 1 cup gluten-free all-purpose mix (1:1)                                                                     | 1 cup GF blend \~ 120 g        | The FODMAP issue with wheat flour is mainly the fructans in wheat, not gluten per se (though gluten-free products often remove wheat anyway, which solves it). A **gluten-free all-purpose flour** (as used for celiac/gluten intolerance) that’s based on rice, potato, tapioca, etc., is typically low-FODMAP (check that no high-FODMAP additives like soy flour or inulin are included). You can substitute such blends cup-for-cup for wheat flour in many recipes (with similar caveats about binding agents as in any GF baking). For bread, using GF flours plus xanthan gum can yield decent results. **Oat flour** and **buckwheat flour** are generally low-FODMAP in moderate serving sizes (1/4 cup or so) – they can replace some wheat flour in pancakes, etc. (Make sure oats are certified GF if gluten cross-contamination is a concern). **Spelt flour** (especially white spelt) is interesting: spelt is wheat family but has shorter-chain fructans and in limited portions (like 2 slices of spelt sourdough bread) can be tolerated by many on FODMAP diet. If a recipe isn’t too flour-heavy, one might use spelt as a “lower-FODMAP” wheat alternative; however, for strict low-FODMAP elimination phase, it’s safer to stick to gluten-free blends. **Almond flour** and **coconut flour** are high fiber and in large amounts can actually be high in FODMAPs (almonds contain GOS and fructans when over \~10 nuts, coconut flour has polyols if in large qty). But small quantities might be okay (e.g., a few tablespoons almond meal in a crumble topping likely fine). **Rice flour** and **corn starch** are safe – they have no FODMAPs (pure starch). So for thickening or breading, you can directly sub wheat flour with rice flour 1:1. In summary, use gluten-free products liberally – they not only cater to gluten-free but also avoid FODMAP fructans. One note: xanthan gum (common in GF flour) is a polysaccharide, but not a FODMAP (not fermentable to small sugars). Still, a few IBS folks find gums bother them; if so, you might use guar gum or psyllium husk as alternative binders. Low-FODMAP baking often employs eggs and lactose-free dairy to enrich structure in absence of gluten.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Milk (regular lactose-containing)       | **Lactose-free milk**; **Almond milk** (small servings); **Rice milk**; **Oat milk** (small servings)                                                                         | 1 cup whole milk = 1 cup lactose-free milk (1:1)                                                                                | 1 cup = 240 ml                 | The primary issue with milk is lactose. **Lactose-free cow’s milk** has the lactose pre-broken into glucose and galactose, making it low-FODMAP (generally up to 1 cup per serving is fine). So the simplest sub is to use lactose-free milk identically to regular milk – no change in taste or function. If you prefer plant-based, many are low-FODMAP: **Almond milk** is low-FODMAP up to around 1 cup (240 ml) as per Monash, since the actual almond content is low (almonds themselves have moderate FODMAPs in large quantities, but almond milk is mostly water). **Rice milk** is low-FODMAP in 1 cup servings too – it’s quite neutral in flavor and works well in cooking, though it’s thinner than cow’s milk. **Oat milk** can be higher in fructans if made from a lot of oats – Monash gives about 1/2 cup as a safe serve for some oat milks – so be cautious or choose certified low-FODMAP oat milk if available (some brands use enzyme treatment to cut GOS). **Soy milk** is tricky: if made from whole soybeans, it’s high in GOS (not good), but if made from soy protein isolate it can be low-FODMAP – check the type. In general, almond, rice, lactose-free, or possibly hemp milk are the go-to. Use them 1:1 for milk in any recipe. Nutritionally, almond and rice milk have less protein and often thinner consistency, but culinarily they behave similarly (might be slightly less creamy). If making pudding or bechamel, lactose-free dairy will thicken like normal; almond milk might be a bit thinner result but still okay (you could add an extra tablespoon of fat or starch to compensate). Taste differences are minor – lactose-free milk is as tasty as regular. Rice milk is very mildly sweet. Almond milk has a hint of nuttiness but in a recipe you usually don’t notice. Also note: **yogurt** substitution would be lactose-free yogurt or coconut yogurt, and **cheese**: many aged cheeses (cheddar, parmesan) are naturally low-lactose so they’re often okay in moderation on low-FODMAP (e.g., 2 slices of cheddar).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Honey (high in fructose)                | **Maple syrup (pure)**; **Brown sugar** (in small amount, mostly sucrose); **Rice malt syrup**                                                                                | 1 Tbsp honey = 1 Tbsp pure maple syrup (1:1)                                                                                    | 1 Tbsp = 15 ml                 | Honey has excess fructose and is high-FODMAP even in small (1 tsp) amounts. **100% pure maple syrup** is the ideal swap – it’s low-FODMAP at typical serving sizes (up to 2 Tbsp). It’s about as sweet as honey, maybe slightly less floral. Use it volume-for-volume the same. E.g., in a marinade needing 2 tablespoons honey, use 2 tablespoons maple syrup – the consistency is a bit runnier than thick honey but that usually doesn’t hurt. **Brown sugar** or white sugar can also replace honey (since sucrose is fine in moderate amounts). If a recipe calls for 1/4 cup honey for baking, you could use 1/4 cup brown sugar + a tablespoon of water to mimic the liquid nature. Sucrose (table sugar) is low-FODMAP (just keep serving sizes reasonable, but generally up to 1/4 cup sugar per serving is considered fine since it’s half fructose, half glucose which helps absorption). **Rice malt syrup** (brown rice syrup) is a low-FODMAP sweetener (it’s basically glucose chains). It’s less sweet than honey – about 3/4 as sweet – but you can use it nearly 1:1. It has a mild, almost butterscotch flavor. For example, replace 1 Tbsp honey with 1 Tbsp rice syrup (if you find it not sweet enough, you might add a pinch of stevia or a bit more syrup). Another option for certain contexts: **golden syrup** (a cane sugar syrup) is low-FODMAP in small doses, or **treacle**. But maple is usually easiest and gives that honey-like viscosity and sweetness. If honey was used raw (like drizzled on yogurt), maple or a sprinkle of brown sugar works. If it was for baking, any invert sugar or syrup will keep things moist similarly. The flavor difference: maple has its distinct flavor (delicious, but different from honey). In most recipes, that’s totally acceptable – e.g., maple granola instead of honey granola. If you specifically need a neutral sweetness, rice syrup or table sugar might be better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Legumes (beans, lentils, etc. high GOS) | **Canned lentils or chickpeas (rinsed)** in small amounts; **Firm tofu** (low in FODMAP); **Quinoa** or **brown rice** (for bulk/protein in salads)                           | 1 cup cooked beans = 1 cup canned lentils (rinsed) (1:1, but limit to \~1/2 cup per serving)                                    | 1 cup = 175 g (cooked lentils) | Legumes are tricky – they’re nutritious but high-FODMAP (GOS and fructans) especially when cooked from dry. However, **canned lentils and chickpeas** are much lower in FODMAPs because some of the GOS leach into the brine which you then rinse off. For example, 1/2 cup (46 g drained) canned chickpeas or 1/2 cup canned lentils are considered low-FODMAP servings by Monash. So if a soup calls for 1 cup of lentils, you can use an equal amount of canned lentils but try to serve smaller portions (like the soup might make 4 servings, each with \~1/4 cup lentils which is fine). **Firm tofu** is another great protein replacement: it’s low-FODMAP because the process of making tofu drains away most soluble carbs. You can use diced firm/extra-firm tofu in stir-fries, stews or salads instead of, say, kidney beans or cubed paneer. E.g., a curry that used 1 cup chickpeas could instead use 1 cup firm tofu cubes – different texture, but still a hearty element (and tofu picks up the curry flavor). **Tempeh**, on the other hand, is made of whole soybeans and can be high in GOS – portion size would need to be very limited or avoided in early phase. For chili con carne, rather than beans, you might double the meat or add diced eggplant or more tomato/pepper etc., then maybe add 1/2 cup of well-rinsed canned black beans just for token beans (spread over 4 servings yields very little per serving). For salads where you’d have had beans, **quinoa** is a nice sub – it gives protein and bulk with a seed-like bite. Use cooked quinoa 1:1 volume in place of, say, chickpeas in a salad (1/2 cup chickpeas \~ 1/2 cup quinoa has similar protein, lower FODMAP). **Peanuts** are actually low-FODMAP (despite being legumes) so peanut butter can stand in for hummus maybe (peanut butter + appropriate spices can make a “peanut hummus”). **Green beans** are low-FODMAP (they’re more pod than bean), so in a soup that called for navy beans, you could toss in some green beans for some veggie presence (though not the same starchy feel). The gist: for pure protein, tofu is excellent; for that starchy satisfaction, use limited canned legumes or swap with grains/veggies that provide body. Always rinse canned beans well – that removes a lot of FODMAP content. If you tolerate a bit more, you might slowly reintroduce more later, but during strict phase stick to small amounts. |
| Wheat bread (high fructan)              | **Sourdough spelt or wheat bread** (traditional slow-fermented); **Gluten-free bread**                                                                                        | 2 slices regular bread = 2 slices true sourdough bread (same quantity)                                                          | 1 slice \~ 30 g                | Regular wheat bread is high-FODMAP due to wheat fructans. However, **sourdough bread** made from wheat or spelt, using a long fermentation, can be much lower in fructans – the sourdough yeast and bacteria break down FODMAPs during proving. Many individuals with IBS can tolerate one or two slices of authentic sourdough (look for traditionally made, not quick yeast bread labeled “sourdough” flavor). For instance, Monash notes that *spelt sourdough* is low-FODMAP at 2 slices. So you could substitute your regular toast with sourdough toast one-for-one. It tastes slightly tangy and has a chewy crust, but otherwise gives the same satisfaction. If sourdough isn’t available or one is extra cautious, **gluten-free bread** (which also will be free of fructans typically) is an easy swap. Use equal slices; just note GF bread can be smaller, so maybe you’d use a bit more if needed. Taste/texture depends on brand – some are quite good, others crumbly. Look for GF bread made of rice, corn, potato starch etc., without added high-FODMAP ingredients like apple fiber or inulin (chicory). If you’re baking, you can get GF flour or make spelt dough and let it ferment. Another angle: **oat bran** or **rice bran** wraps could replace a bread sandwich – e.g., use a 100% oat wrap (if certified GF and portion-controlled) in place of two bread slices. But sourdough is the standout – e.g., replacing regular pizza crust with sourdough crust, or having sourdough rye (if tolerated, rye sourdough is often easier than normal rye bread). Keep in mind that not all sourdough is equal – some commercially baked “sourdough” might not be fully fermented. The bread should have a long rise or say “fermented 24 hours”. In summary, a high quality sourdough or GF bread allows you to enjoy bread in similar amounts without the FODMAP load, with minimal culinary difference (aside from a pleasant tang in sourdough).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Apples, pears (high-fructose fruits)    | **Banana (just ripe, no brown spots)**; **Berries** (strawberry, blueberry, raspberry); **Citrus** (orange, mandarin); **Kiwi**                                               | 1 medium apple (150g) = 1 medium navel orange (180g) (swap whole fruit for whole fruit); or \~10 medium strawberries (150g)     | 1 fruit \~ 150 g               | Many common fruits like apples, pears, watermelon, mango have excess fructose or polyols. Safer fruits include **bananas** (firm, just-ripe bananas are low-FODMAP at \~100g, though overripe have higher fructans), **citrus fruits** (oranges, mandarins, grapefruit all low-FODMAP in typical servings), **grapes**, **kiwifruit**, **berries** (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries in moderate portions). So if a recipe calls for apples (say, an apple pie or fruit salad), you might replace apples with a mix of strawberries and rhubarb (rhubarb is low-FODMAP) for a pie, or use firm bananas or blueberries in a fruit salad instead of apples. For example, one chopped apple (\~1 cup) in a salad could be replaced by 1 cup of halved grapes or 1 cup of cubed cantaloupe (melon is low-FODMAP in \~1/2 cup serves). **Kiwi** is a great sub for green apple in terms of color and a bit of tartness; 2 kiwis (low-FODMAP) can replace 1 apple in a fruit platter. If the apples/pears were for sweetness and bulk in baking, try using tolerated fruits like diced strawberries or a smaller amount of ripe banana for sweetness (note banana can change texture – maybe mash to incorporate). **Orange zest/juice** can also impart some aromatic sweetness if apples were there for aroma; e.g., in an apple muffin recipe, you could use 1/2 cup mashed ripe banana plus some orange zest to stand in for 1 cup apple sauce. For snacking, simply swap an apple with an orange or a handful of berries. **Frozen blueberries** can replace apples in oatmeal (just keep to \~1/4 cup blueberries per serving to be safe on FODMAP load). **Dragonfruit (pitaya)** is another low-FODMAP fruit if exotic is an option – it has a mild sweet taste and could replace pears in a fruit salad visually (white with tiny seeds). **Papaya** and **pineapple** are also low-FODMAP choices. Essentially, any fruit high in fructose like apple or mango can be swapped with an equal amount of a fruit that has a better glucose\:fructose balance (or lower polyols). This ensures the sweetness and fiber is still there but less trigger potential. Just be mindful of quantity – multiple low-FODMAP fruits in one sitting can add up to a FODMAP load collectively. Usually 1 serving at a time is the guideline in elimination phase.                                                                                              |
